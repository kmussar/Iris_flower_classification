# Iris_flower_classification
classification of flowers into 3 species using petal and sepal measurements

## Background
The Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by Sir Ronald Fisher in the 1936 as an example of discriminant analysis. 

## The Dataset
The iris dataset contains measurements for 150 iris flowers from three different species.

The three classes in the Iris dataset:

    Iris-setosa (n=50)
    Iris-versicolor (n=50)
    Iris-virginica (n=50)

The four features of the Iris dataset:

    sepal length in cm
    sepal width in cm
    petal length in cm
    petal width in cm

This dataset is so famous, it has a wikipedia page! You can find it here: [Iris flower data set](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set).
